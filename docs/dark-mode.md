Each and every components implments the Redux, with the help of `ReduxWrapper` Component, and extract the `darkMode` from `appSate` 
Reducer.

const someFunction = ()=>{
    toggleDarkMode$()
}
    return(
        <>
        My JSX......
        </>
    )
    
}
export default ReduxWrapper(MyComponent)
```
