## Alert
Alert messages are very commenly used prompter in every mobile application. 
We have used a [Drop down](https://github.com/testshallpass/react-native-dropdownalert) alert for that. 

## How to show message
Very easy to show the alert messages, 
```
import AlertHelper from 'Utils/AlertHelper'; 

AlertHelper.show('message Type', 'Your message')

```
For more please check [Offcial docs of Alert](https://github.com/testshallpass/react-native-dropdownalert) 

# How to redesign 
Pretty easy to redesign the alert helper. Go to [App.js](../App.js)
You will find `DropdownAlert` Component you can modify its props, [visit here](https://github.com/testshallpass/react-native-dropdownalert) to how to modify
