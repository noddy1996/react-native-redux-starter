## Error bondray 
Yes, you heared it right, Ther is an error boundry which is protecting your application in production form unexpected crashes.
There is nothing for you to do with that.
But yes you can re-design the fallback screen. For that you should [go to](../app/ErrorBoundry/index.js) 
under the render function you can write your own code. Make sure you don`t mess with the conditional rendering.
